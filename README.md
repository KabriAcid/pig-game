# Pig Game

This is an enhanced version of the classic Pig Game, based on Jonas Schmetdman' original project.

## History of Pig Game

The Pig Game is a popular dice game with simple rules that have been enjoyed by families and friends for decades. The game was first introduced as a children's dice game, aiming to combine luck and strategy in a fun and accessible way.

The core mechanics involve players rolling dice to accumulate points. However, players must choose between continuing to roll the dice for more points or holding their score to avoid losing it on a roll of "1". This adds a layer of risk and decision-making to the game, making it a mix of luck and strategy.

Pig's simplicity and ease of play have made it a favorite among casual gamers, and it has inspired numerous digital adaptations, including the one you're enjoying here. This digital version includes added features like sound effects, tortoise race progress tracking, and personalized player names, which enhance the experience while maintaining the classic charm of the original game.


## New Features:

- **Background Music**: Toggle between playing and pausing background music.
- **Sound Effects**: Sounds for dice rolls, holding points, and a celebration sound when a player wins.
- **Tortoise Progress**: Visual tortoise race track that shows progress towards winning.
- **Personalized Gameplay**: Players can enter their names and set a score limit.
- **Individual Player Controls**: Each player has their own "Roll" and "Hold" buttons, allowing independent control of actions.
- **Celebration Sound**: A celebration sound effect plays when a player wins the game.

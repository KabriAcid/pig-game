# Pig Game

## Inspiration
Inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Description
This is a version of the classic *Pig* game, where players roll a dice and accumulate points based on the rolls, but risk losing all accumulated points if they roll a 1. The game continues until one player reaches a specified score limit.

### New Features Added
- **Background Music**: Added looping background music to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Dice roll and hold actions are accompanied by sound effects for better immersion.
- **Tortoise Tracking Progress**: Visual progress tracking using tortoise images that move based on each player's score.
- **Player Names & Score Limit**: Players can input custom names and set a score limit for the game.
- **Individual Roll & Hold Buttons**: Each player has their own dedicated buttons for rolling the dice and holding points to avoid conflicts.
- **Celebration Sound Effect**: A celebration sound plays when a player wins.

## How to Play
1. Roll the dice by clicking the **Roll Dice** button or pressing **Shift**.
2. Accumulate points based on the dice roll, but if you roll a **1**, you lose all points for that turn.
3. Hold your points by clicking the **Hold** button or pressing **Space**.
4. The first player to reach the score limit wins the game.
5. A tortoise track shows the progress of each player.

## History of the Pig Game
The *Pig Game* (also known as *Pig Dice*) has its roots in a simple dice game that evolved over time into various forms. One of its most popular versions, known as *Pass the Pigs*, was created in 1977 by David Moffat. The game involved rolling small plastic pigs to determine the outcome based on how they landed. The game, initially called *Pig Mania*, was later rebranded and released by Milton Bradley as *Pass the Pigs*.

The game combines luck and strategy, as players need to decide whether to take another roll and risk losing their points or hold onto their accumulated score. It's a fun game suitable for all ages, improving both basic math skills and decision-making.

## History of the Pig Game
The *Pig Game* (also known as *Pig Dice*) has its roots in a simple dice game that evolved over time into various forms. One of its most popular versions, known as *Pass the Pigs*, was created in 1977 by David Moffat. The game involved rolling small plastic pigs to determine the outcome based on how they landed. The game, initially called *Pig Mania*, was later rebranded and released by Milton Bradley as *Pass the Pigs*.

The game combines luck and strategy, as players need to decide whether to take another roll and risk losing their points or hold onto their accumulated score. It's a fun game suitable for all ages, improving both basic math skills and decision-making.
